# Docker Deployment

New repo here: https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-boundary-prometheus-metrics

This directory contains an example deployment of Boundary using docker-compose
and Terraform. The lab environment is meant to accompany the Hashicorp Learn
[Boundary health metrics
tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/prometheus-metrics).

In this example, Boundary is deployed using the
[hashicorp/boundary](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/boundary) Dockerhub
image. The Boundary service ports are forwarded to the host machine to mimic
being in a "public" network. Boundary is provisioned via Terraform to include a
postgres databases target.

This deployment includes:

- boundary controller
- boundary worker
- boundary database
- prometheus
- grafana
- postgres

The postgres target container is not port forwarded to the host machine in order
to mimic residing in a private network. Boundary is configured to reach this
target via Docker DNS (domain names defined by their service name in
docker-compose). Clients can reach the target via Boundary, and an example is
given below.

## Getting Started 

There is a helper script called `deploy` in this directory. You can use this
script to deploy, login, and cleanup.

Start the docker-compose deployment:

```bash
./deploy all
```

To login your Boundary CLI:

```bash
./deploy login
```

To stop all containers and start from scratch:

```bash
./deploy cleanup
```

Login to the UI:
  - Open browser to localhost:9200
  - Login Name: user1
  - Password: password
  - Auth method ID: find this in the UI when selecting the auth method or from TF output

```bash
$ boundary authenticate password -login-name user1 -password password -auth-method-id <get_from_console_or_tf>

Authentication information:
  Account ID:      apw_gAE1rrpnG2
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_Qrwp0l7UH4
  Expiration Time: Fri, 06 Nov 2020 07:17:01 PST
  Token:           at_NXiLK0izep_s14YkrMC6A4MajKyPekeqTTyqoFSg3cytC4cP8sssBRe5R8cXoerLkG7vmRYAY5q1Ksfew3JcxWSevNosoKarbkWABuBWPWZyQeUM1iEoFcz6uXLEyn1uVSKek7g9omERHrFs
```

## Connect to Postgres

Once the deployment is live, you can connect to the container (assuming the
postgres client is installed on your host system). Log into the Postgres
container via Boundary, providing the password `postgres` when prompted:

```bash
$ boundary connect postgres -target-name postgres -target-scope-name databases -username postgres -- -l
Password for user postgres:
                                 List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges

           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres

           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 test1     | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 |
(4 rows)
```

Default passwords are set via env vars in the docker-compose.yml file.
